# 🛠️ AI-Powered Support Ticket Classifier

A complete machine learning pipeline that classifies customer support tickets by issue type and urgency level, and extracts critical entities like product names, complaint keywords, and dates — all accessible through a sleek Gradio web interface.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer support teams handle thousands of tickets daily. Manually classifying and extracting key information from these tickets is time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates:

- 🔍 Ticket Classification: Predicts issue_type and urgency_level.

- 🧠 Entity Extraction: Extracts key entities such as product names, complaint keywords, and dates.

- 🌐 Gradio Interface: Allows end users to interactively classify tickets in a user-friendly UI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (lowercasing, lemmatization, stopwords removal)

- TF-IDF & Feature Engineering (ticket length, sentiment scores)

- Multi-Task Classification using Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest

- Entity Extraction using rule-based NLP (product names, dates, complaint terms)

- Saved Models for inference reuse

- Gradio Frontend for real-time predictions

## 🧠 ML Models

- Multi-class Classification

    - issue_type: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest (best one selected)

    - urgency_level: Trained similarly

- Entity Extraction

    - Regex + Keyword-based patterns for products, dates, and complaint terms

## ✨ Sample Input

Input:

    "I received the EcoBreeze AC and it’s broken. Also, I ordered on April 5th."

Output:
```bash
{
  "issue_type": "Product Defect",
  "urgency_level": "High",
  "extracted_entities":
  {
    "products": ["EcoBreeze AC"],
    "dates": ["April 5th"],
    "complaint_keywords": ["broken"]
  }
}
```

## 📚 Dependencies

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `textblob`

- `gradio` for UI

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Integrate deep learning models (e.g., `BERT`)

- Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) with spaCy or transformers

- Support multilingual ticket classification

- `Database`/`API` backend for enterprise usage
